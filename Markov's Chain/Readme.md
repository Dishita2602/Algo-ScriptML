# Markov's Chain
## What is Markov's Chain
_**A stochastic process containing random variables, transitioning from one state to another depending on certain assumptions and definite probabilistic rules.**_

These random  variables transition from one to state to the other, based on an important mathematical property called  **Markov Property.**
### Markov's Property :
_Discrete Time Markov Property states that the calculated probability of a random process transitioning to the next possible state is only dependent on the current state and time and it is independent of the series of states that preceded it._

The fact that the next possible action/ state of a random process does not depend on the sequence of prior states, renders Markov chains as a memory-less process that solely depends on the current state/action of a variable.

Let’s derive this mathematically:

Let the random process be, {Xm, m=0,1,2,⋯}.

This process is a Markov chain only if,

for all m, j, i, i0, i1, ⋯ im−1

For a finite number of states, S={0, 1, 2, ⋯, r}, this is called a finite Markov chain.

P(Xm+1 = j|Xm = i) here represents the transition probabilities to transition from one state to the other. Here, we’re assuming that the transition probabilities are independent of time.

Which means that P(Xm+1 = j|Xm = i) does not depend on the value of ‘m’. Therefore, we can summarise,v

So this equation represents  the Markov chain.

## **What Is A State Transition Diagram?**

A Markov model is represented by a State Transition Diagram. The diagram shows the transitions among the different states in a Markov Chain. Let’s understand the transition matrix and the state transition matrix with an example.

### **Transition Matrix Example**

Consider a Markov chain with three states 1, 2, and 3 and the following probabilities:

_State Transition Diagram Example – Introduction To Markov Chains 

The above diagram represents the state transition diagram for the Markov chain. Here, 1,2 and 3 are the three possible states, and the arrows pointing from one state to the other states represents the transition probabilities pij. When, pij=0, it means that there is no transition between state ‘i’ and state ‘j’.

## Steps :
- **Step 1: Import the required packages**
- **Step 2: Read the data set**
- **Step 3: Split the data set into individual words**
- **Step 4: Creating pairs to keys and the follow-up words**
- **Step 5: Appending the dictionary**
- **Step 6: Build the Markov model**

**Markov Chain Applications**

Here’s a list of real-world applications of Markov chains:

1.  **Google PageRank:**  The entire web can be thought of as a Markov model, where every web page can be a state and the links or references between these pages can be thought of as, transitions with probabilities. So basically, irrespective of which web page you start surfing on, the chance of getting to a certain web page, say, X is a fixed probability.
    
2.  **Typing Word Prediction:** Markov chains are known to be used for predicting upcoming words. They can also be used in auto-completion and suggestions.
    
3.  **Subreddit Simulation:** Surely you’ve come across Reddit and had an interaction on one of their threads or subreddits. Reddit uses a subreddit simulator that consumes a huge amount of data containing all the comments and discussions held across their groups. By making use of Markov chains, the simulator produces word-to-word probabilities, to create comments and topics.
    
4.  **Text generator:** Markov chains are most commonly used to generate dummy texts or produce large essays and compile speeches. It is also used in the name generators that you see on the web.
